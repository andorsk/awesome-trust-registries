A curated list of trust registry systems and adjacent technology.

Disclaimer: Not all protocols and models are interoperable. 

## Protocols

- [DNSsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions) : A suite of extension specifications by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for securing data exchanged in the Domain Name System (DNS) in Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Used sometimes for extending to Trust Registries.
- [Extensible Provisioning Protocol](https://icannwiki.org/Extensible_Provisioning_Protocol) : an XML based protocol used by the Internet industry, particularly the registrars and registries in managing domain names.
- [Open ID Federation \(OIDF\)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html) : A specification that describes how two Entities that would like to interact can establish trust between them by means of a trusted third party called a Trust Anchor.
- [Trust Registry Protocol v2](https://github.com/trustoverip/tswg-trust-registry-protocol) : API based protocol that asks: `Does Entity X have Authorization Y, in the context of Ecosystem Governance Framework Z?`
- [WHOIS](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3912) :  WHOIS is a TCP-based transaction-oriented query/response protocol that is widely used to provide information services to Internet users.
- [Registry Lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registrar-Lock) : Status code set by registrar intended to combats domain hijacking.
- [RDAP](https://www.icann.org/rdap) : IETF based protocol that enables users to access current registration data and was created as an eventual replacement for the WHOIS protocol. 
- [RPKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Public_Key_Infrastructure) : proves the association between specific IP address blocks or ASNs and the holders of those Internet number resources. 

## Models

- [Credential Trust Establishment](https://identity.foundation/credential-trust-establishment/): A document model that describes whether a user should trust the issuer of this credential?. 
- [EBSI Trust Chains](https://hub.ebsi.eu/get-started/design/trust-chain) : An interaction model which defines three roles: Root Trusted Accreditation Organisation (Root TAO), Trusted Accreditation Organisation(s) (TAOs), and Trusted Issuer(s) (TIs).
- [x509 Certs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509): A standard defining the format of public key certificates used as a basis for HTTPS and TLS. 
- [W3C Verified Issuer / Verifier Verifier List Data Model](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/verifiable-issuers-verifiers/) : This work focuses on how a party or its agent can decide whether or not to engage with a counterparty in a transaction.

- [Trinsic](https://docs.trinsic.id/reference/services/trust-registry-service/) : Trust Registry API using Trust Over IP's Trust Registry Protocol v1 spec.
- [TRAIN](https://train.trust-scheme.de/info/) : The approach allows for the flexible definition, consideration and publication of trust lists as well as the verification of trust framework compliance (e.g., eIDAS including LoAs or other trust framework/schemes that can also be application/industry-specific) with different Levels of Assurance (LoA), using DNS(SEC) as a root trust anchor. 
- [Who.is](https://www.whois.com/whois/whois.net) : A Whois domain lookup allows you to trace the ownership and tenure of a domain name.
- [Yoti](https://www.yoti.com/) : SSI Network
